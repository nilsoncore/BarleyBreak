# BarleyBreak

## Usage

This algorithm checks solvability of a 3x3 barley-break position and solves it if it's possible.

Input of a position like:
*    x x x
*    x x x
*    x x x

... should be written in a console as follows:
*    x x x x x x x x x

Empty slot should be reffered as '0'.

For example:
*   1 2 3
*   4 0 6
*   7 5 8

... should be written as follows:

*   1 2 3 4 0 6 7 5 8
